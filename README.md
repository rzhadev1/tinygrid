# tinygrid 

tinygrid is an implementation of the linearized (DC) security constrained economic dispatch problem (SCED), written in pyomo. Pyomo is a flexible mathematical optimization interface that allows one to abstract implementation details of optimization solvers. 

tinygrid is currently tested on the sample Texas ERCOT grid provided by Texas A&M.
