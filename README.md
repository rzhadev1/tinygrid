# tinygrid 

This is an implementation of the linearized (DC) security constrained economic dispatch problem (SCED). The main goal is to learn pyomo and the properties of SCED, while attempting to create a lightweight and minimalist implementation.  


# TODO 
- implement B, theta flow constraint
- work on dispatch solution, getting duals, making output
